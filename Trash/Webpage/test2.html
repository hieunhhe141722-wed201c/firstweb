		<h3>What's Debate mean?</h3>
		According to: <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/">Cambridge Dictionary</a> a debate is a discussion about a subject on which people have different views. Of course if when you play the role calls <font color="blue">Debater</font> you must do several things to ensure that your logic and evidence fit the topic. In order to do such things, you might need a team with different roles for example: 
		<p>
			<dl>
				<dt><font size="5">Carrer</font></dt>
					<dd>- This is a group of people will assign to take care of your team health problem.But normally this role doesn't exit because it doesn't really matter.<br>
					</dd>
				<dt><font size="5">Leader</font></dt>
					<dd>- Create Vision: Clearly define where your team is going and how they are going to get there.<br>
						- Execute Strategy: Consistently achieve results with and through others using disciplined processes.<br>
						- Coach Potential: Unleash the ability of each person on your team to improve performance, solve problems, and grow their careers.<br>
						- Execute their vision and strategy all the way through to completion, with and through others.<br>
						- Create a shared vision and strategy, and communicate it so powerfully that others join them on the journey.
					</dd>
				<dt><font size="5">Researcher</font></dt>
					<dd>
						- This is one of the most important role in a Debate team because win or lose depends on this group.<br>
						- Researchers have to find the document: <font color="blue">what, who, why, when, how,...</font>. Make sure that every doc that you found related and from reliable source(org, gov,...)<br>
						- Every piece of information are very important, and this team also have to merge the team flow of argument. Know when to use the evident to prove an idea in the Argument.<br>
						- Researcher group can be very tough because some info are private(Need Special Licence to access), that why this take most of people in the team to work together inorder to find best evident.<br> 
					</dd>
				<dt><font size="5">Questioner</font></dt>
					<dd>- This group will think of every question that benefit your team but strong enough to shut down the enemy team.<br>
						- But there are important notes that this group have to remember:
							<dd>
								1. Ask the questions that strongly related to the topic.<br>
								2. Work with <font color="blue">Researcher</font> group to take the information like: evident, the flow of your team argument.<br>
								3. Make sure that every evident that you have is 100% correct or else your enemy team will strike right into that weakspot.<br>
								4. Take notes of enemy team argument flow and evident. That could help your team form new question based on your evident about the same subject.
							</dd>
					</dd>
				<dt><font size="5">Black-Hat Wearer</font></dt>
					<dd>- This group need people with very big brains. Why? They are the one who will find every issue that still remain in your team Argument. They can be calls as Manager in your team.<br>
						- But normally this group is the present of <font color="blue">Leader and Questioner</font> group.
